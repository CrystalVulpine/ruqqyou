# ruqqyou
Ruqqyou is a browser extension for Ruqqus that personalizes your experience. It can:

* Filter posts and comments with a custom list of words.
* Block posts from certain guilds everywhere, as opposed to only on /all.
* Silently block users without preventing them from seeing you.

It is not released anywhere yet, but you can download the code and load the extension unpacked.
