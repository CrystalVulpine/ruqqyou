Ruqqyou is a browser extension for [Ruqqus](https://github.com/ruqqus/ruqqus) that personalizes your experience. It can:

* Filter posts and comments with a custom list of words.
* Block posts from certain guilds everywhere, as opposed to only on /all.
* Silently block users without preventing them from seeing you.

To install ruqqyou, [download it from here](https://github.com/CrystalVulpine/ruqqyou/releases), extract the files and load the extension unpacked in your browser. It has not been published on any stores yet, however that will be looked into in the future.
